# Quick Start

Based on your specific needs, it is recommended to selectively follow the documentation paths below:

### I Want to Use Plugins

If youâ€™re looking to quickly install and start using plugins, prioritize the following content:

{% content-ref url="install-plugins.md" %}
[install-plugins.md](install-plugins.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### I Want to Develop Plugins

If you plan to develop plugins yourself, follow these steps to progressively dive deeper:

#### 1. Quick Start

Explore development examples for various plugin types to grasp the basic structure and development process quickly.

{% content-ref url="develop-plugins/tool-plugin.md" %}
[tool-plugin.md](develop-plugins/tool-plugin.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="develop-plugins/model-plugin/" %}
[model-plugin](develop-plugins/model-plugin/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="develop-plugins/agent-strategy-plugin.md" %}
[agent-strategy-plugin.md](develop-plugins/agent-strategy-plugin.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="develop-plugins/extension-plugin.md" %}
[extension-plugin.md](develop-plugins/extension-plugin.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="develop-plugins/bundle.md" %}
[bundle.md](develop-plugins/bundle.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

#### 2. Advanced Development

Read the **Endpoint Documentation** to gain an in-depth understanding of **key interfaces** and **implementation details** in plugin development.

{% content-ref url="../schema-definition/" %}
[schema-definition](../schema-definition/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

You can tailor your learning based on your specific needs to efficiently master the use or development of plugins and achieve your goals effectively.

This section primarily focuses on guiding you through the installation and use of plugins.
